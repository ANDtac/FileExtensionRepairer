# FileExtensionRepairer

Project Title: File Extension Repairer - Automatic File Type Detection and Extension Correction with Python

Project Description:

The File Extension Repairer is a Python script designed to address the issue of mislabeled or missing file extensions. It scans a specified directory, automatically detects the correct file type for each file, and fixes the file extension if needed. This project highlights the ability to develop a user-friendly and efficient solution for fixing file extension issues, ensuring that files can be easily accessed and managed.

Features:

Automatic file type detection: The script utilizes Python libraries to accurately detect the file type for each file, even if the extension is missing or incorrect.
Extension correction: If a file's extension is found to be incorrect or missing, the script automatically updates it with the correct extension.
Recursive directory scanning: The File Extension Repairer can process nested directories, ensuring that all files within the specified folder and its subfolders are analyzed and corrected.
Error handling: The script includes error handling mechanisms to prevent file loss or corruption during the extension repair process.
User-friendly interface: The script is designed with ease of use in mind, featuring clear instructions and helpful prompts to guide users through the process.
How it works:

The user provides the directory path containing the files with potentially incorrect or missing extensions.
The script scans the specified directory and its subdirectories, analyzing each file to determine its correct file type.
If the script detects an incorrect or missing file extension, it automatically updates the file with the appropriate extension.
The script provides a summary of the changes made, informing the user of the number of files processed and the extensions repaired.
Project Outcome:

The File Extension Repairer demonstrates the ability to create a practical and efficient solution for automatically detecting and correcting file extensions. By ensuring that files have the correct extensions, the script helps users maintain a well-organized and easily accessible digital workspace. This project showcases the potential of Python for creating user-friendly, powerful, and time-saving solutions that streamline everyday tasks and improve digital file management.
